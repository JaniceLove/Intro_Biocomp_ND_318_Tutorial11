#create alignments (using Muscle) for each reference set of sequences
muscle -in sigma.ref -out sigma.align
muscle -in sporecoat.ref -out sporecoat.align
muscle -in transporter.ref -out transporter.align
 
#build a profile  HMM model (using hmmer) from each alignment file
hmmbuild sigma.hmmbuild sigma.align
hmmbuild sporecoat.hmmbuild sporecoat.align
hmmbuild transporter.hmmbuild transporter.align

#search fasta files for protein type: sigma factor, sugar transporter, spore formation component

#generate single results file: row for each match from all HMM-proteome combinations 
#fit to table: include columns indicating species/proteome, HMM-match, e-value with each match 
#Species/proteome comes from sequence names. We only care about the last few characters _XXXX, remove all characters prior (incl pipes)
